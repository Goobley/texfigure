texfigure is a package of Python helpers to make working with
figures in a [PythonTex](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex)
document easier and prettier.

Most of the code in this package was initally written to make figure
management in my Thesis easier, however it can be applied to any
document.

**NB (CMO):** The examples in this repository are pretty outdated, as the code here was adjusted to work in my [thesis](https://github.com/Goobley/Thesis).
